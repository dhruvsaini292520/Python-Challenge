# Python-Challenge
This Python script is designed to extract data from 2 seperate CSV files based on the given answers. It was created as part of a homework assignment for the Data Analytics bootcamp Week 3.
I have used the class resources to combine all concepts taught in week 3 and applied it to the given datasets here to get the desired results. I have tested the code at each level, to make sure it is execuing as intended.
